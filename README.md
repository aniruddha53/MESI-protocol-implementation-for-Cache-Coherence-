# MESI-protocol-implementation-for-Cache-Coherence-

1. Simulation of the Last Level Cache(LLC) for a new processor that can be used with up to three
   other processors in a shared memory configuration.
2. The cache has a total capacity of 16MB, uses 64-byte lines, and is 8-way set associative. It
   employs a write allocate policy and uses the MESI protocol to ensure cache coherence. The
   replacement policy is implemented with a pseudo-LRU scheme.
   
Accomplishments:
1. Successfully simulated Last Level Cache(LLC) using C programming.
2. Designed the Pseudo Last Recently Used(PLRU) strategy for determining Cache Replacement.
